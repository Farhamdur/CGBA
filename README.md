# CGBA: Curvature-aware Geometric Black-box Attack
Welcome to our repository featuring the official implementation of the CGBA algorithm. This work is accepted for publication in ICCV 2023.
## Requirements
Before executing the code, ensure that the following packages are installed in your environment:
* PyTorch and Trochvision
* Numpy
* Os
* SciPy
  
Or you can type the following to create an environment:  

```
conda env create -f cgba_env.yml
```

## Run
1. To execute the non-targeted attack, run `Non_targeted_attack.py`.
2. To execute the targeted attack, run `Targeted_attack.py`.

## Citation
Please consider citing our paper in your publications if it contributes to your research.
